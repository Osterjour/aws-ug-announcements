# What is this all about?
At the [AWS Usergroup Munich](http://aws-muc.de) we always do a so called "AWS recent announcements" talk before we start with the technical talks at our meet ups. Many attendees asked that we should make the slides available so that everybody is able to share them within their team or company.

**Please note: These slides are highly filtered to match the expectations of a short meet up talk - so this is not an exhausive or complete list of all AWS announcements!**
If you're searching for such a list please refer to the [official blogs and list](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/) of AWS!
